Java Packages & API
A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:
    1. Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
    2. User-defined Packages (create your own packages)
