/*
To create a file in Java, you can use the createNewFile() method.
This method returns a boolean value: true if the file was successfully created, 
and false if the file already exists. 
Note that the method is enclosed in a try...catch block. This is necessary because it throws an 
IOException if an error occurs (if the file cannot be created for some reason):
*/

import java.io.File;  // Import the File class
import java.io.IOException;  // Import the IOException class to handle errors

public class _02_CreateFile {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      File myObj = new File("filename.txt");
      if (myObj.createNewFile()) {
        System.out.println("File created: " + myObj.getName());
      } else {
        System.out.println("File already exists.");
      }
    } catch (IOException e) {
      System.out.println("An error occurred.");
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}

/*
Note: 
To create a file in a specific directory (requires permission), specify the path of the file 
and use double backslashes to escape the "\" character (for Windows). On Mac and Linux 
you can just write the path, like: /Users/name/filename.txt
Example
    File myObj = new File("C:\\Users\\MyName\\filename.txt");
